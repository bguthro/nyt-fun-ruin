# NYT Games Fun Ruiner

This is the result of a joke that got out of hand.

It will solve some of the NYT games, and use iMessage to send it to whomever you don't like.

## Why would I want this?

Petty revenge?

Maybe you just don't enjoy fun. I'm not here to judge.

## How does this work?

This relies on you logging into NYT via your browser at least once. It then uses the cookie from that session to go look up solutions for:

- The daily mini
- Wordle
- Connections
- Spelling bee

Optionally, it can also send these results via iMessage
